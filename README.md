These are some instructions for downloading the software that you should be able to use for working with our robot.
If at any point you are asked for a password and the 2016 challenge hasn't begun yet, try: R3C3CL3RU$H2015

1.	Please install the FRC Update Suite at this link or from the ZIP file I may have provided.
	https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/4485/m/13809/l/144150-installing-the-frc-2015-update-suite-all-languages
	The update suite should give you a list of programs but mostly you will only ever use the driver station software.

2. 	Also, please install the FRC Windows Toolchain
	http://first.wpi.edu/FRC/roborio/toolchains/

3.	While that is installing, please follow the instructions at the following site.
	Be thorough and read EVERYTHING!!! It can easily not work and be a major pain if you don't follow the instructions thoroughly.
	You must install the C/C++ version of eclipse or you will have to install the CDT files yourself and there's not much help for troubleshooting if you mess up.
